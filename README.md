# Overview
Campaign rules

Goal: Capture all the villains before your heroes are captured.

You capture a villain by defeating it, but every time you lose, one of your heroes is captured and eliminated from the campaign. The campaign rules will require you to face many of the villains on Advanced Difficulty.

Villains are faced in random order, in a random environment. For the environments, choose one randomly for each game, from among the ones that have not been used yet, until all have been used.

Your team of heroes will change between games: Sometimes changes will come due to a hero getting captured when you lose. In that case, you get to hand-pick (non-randomly) the replacement. Sometimes, however, heroes are randomly called away on other missions and replaced with a new random hero. In fact, this will happen all the time. Finally, sometimes a random hero will show up to help you by expanding your team to 4 heroes. The steps below describe how to revise your team between battles. General rule: do all random stuff before the things where you have to make a choice.

For all games, you get to decide the turn order for the heroes at the beginning of the game.

For all games played on advanced difficulty, each hero draws one additional card at the start of the battle. This represents the experience gained from the team as the campaign progresses.

# Called Away
After every fight, win or lose, one of your heroes will be called away on another (off-screen) mission. The hero to be called away is chosen randomly, and is then replaced with a RANDOM hero. The exception to this rule is that if the hero who would be called away is the nemesis of the next villain you will face, then the hero is instead NOT called away, and you skip this rule.

# Start of the campaign
1. Pick a random villain and environment.
2. Hand pick your starting team of \<number of players\> heroes, non-randomly.
3. Play the game on standard non-advanced difficulty.

# When you win a fight
1. The villain is captured and removed from the campaign.
2. Randomly draw your next villain and environment.
3. Determine which hero is "called away" and replaced, as explained above.
4. Finally, because you won the previous fight, the new villain comes in with a vengeance, and must be faced on Advanced Difficulty.

# When you lose a fight
1. One of your heroes is captured. This is your choice (not random), UNLESS one or more of the heroes are the nemesis of the victorious villain. If there are any nemeses on the table, then you must pick the captured hero from among those. For this rule, non-character cards (including environment cards) that have a nemesis icon DO count as a nemesis, as long as they are currently in play when the game ended. After the capture, if you are unable to field a team of at least \<number of players\> heroes, then you have LOST the campaign.

2. Now choose whether to face the same villain again, or draw a new one. If you draw a new villain, you face him on non-advanced difficulty, and the old villain returns to the pool of available choices. You will definitely have to defeat him or her later in order to win the campain. If you choose to face the same villain who just defeated you, then you get to pick one of the Advantages below. Each Advantage stays in effect for future games until you defeat (or redraw) the villain that defeated you.
    * Advantage 1: Remove Advanced Difficulty from the villain.
    * Advantage 2: Pick the environment non-randomly, instead of randomly. You can choose from any environments, even ones that have been used already. (This can be a fairly weak Advantage, but sometimes you just need an easy environment to beat a tough villain. Or, if you accidentally lost to an easy villain, you may wish to pick a hard environment just to get it out of the mix for future villains.)
    * Advantage 3: This may only be chosen if the villain captured his nemesis in the previous battle. Before the battle, reveal \<num of players\> + 1 reward cards that "make sense" from the top of the mission deck. Each hero picks one of these and begins with it in play. This game is played on Advanced + Challenge difficulty.
3. After choosing your Advantage, then proceed with drawing a new random environment (unless your Advantage was to select it non-randomly).

4. Now determine which hero is "called away" and replaced.

5. At this point, you should be one hero short of your intended team size, due to a hero getting captured. So, you get to non-randomly choose the hero you want to fill in the gap.


Special rule for Vengeful Five: Every time you fight this "villain", you randomly draw the individual villains who will fight you. So, the roster can change even if you face the Vengeful Five twice in a row. If you win the fight, you have captured the whole team.


# The "Annual"
This is a special rule that comes up on every 12th game. On Game 12 (and 24, etc.) follow these steps:
1. A Villain Returns: This fight will be against a random villain from among the ones you have already captured. If that villain wins this game, it escapes and returns to the pool of available villains. Otherwise, it remains captured. You fight this villain on non-advanced difficulty. If there was already a different villain that you were supposed to fight (due to losing Game 11), then that villain instead returns to the pool, and will come up later.

2. Make a new Hero Team: You get \<number of players\> heroes, according to the following rules:
   * Choose one member of your existing team to carry on. This is non-random, but must be a nemesis of the upcoming villain if possible.
   * A Hero Returns: Choose a previously captured hero. This choice is also non-random, except that you must choose a hero who is the nemesis of the villain if possible. If not possible, then choose any previously captured hero. If you win, the hero has escaped capture, and is now part of your pool of available heroes. If you lose, that hero is automatically the one who is captured. (Normally, a villain always captures its nemesis if possible, but for the Annual, the villain will always capture a hero attempting to escape, even if a different hero is the nemesis.)
   * "And Introducing....": A new hero also joins your team, if possible. Choose a random hero from your available pool, who has NEVER been used in the campaign yet (no special nemesis rules for this). If you have no heroes that haven't been used yet, then choose the one who has been used the least, breaking ties randomly.

3. Following the Annual, win or lose, you will fight a random different villain from the available pool on non-advanced difficulty. (This is an exception to the normal rule requiring you to face the next villain on Advanced Difficulty if you win or gaining an Advantage if you lose.) You do still need to randomly determine a hero to be "called away", per normal rules.
